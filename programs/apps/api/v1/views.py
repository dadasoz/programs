    **Use Cases**

        List and update existing Programs, create new Programs, and find completed Programs.

    **Example Requests**

        # Return a list of programs in the system.
        GET /api/v1/programs/

        If the request is successful, the HTTP status will be 200 and the response body will
        contain a JSON-formatted array of programs.

        # Create a new program.
        POST /api/v1/programs/

        If the request is successful, the HTTP status will be 201 and the response body will
        contain a JSON-formatted representation of the newly-created program.

        Only users with global administrative rights may create programs. POST requests from non-
        admins will result in status 403.

        # Update existing Program.
        PATCH /api/v1/programs/{program_id}

        If the request is successful, the HTTP status will be 200 and the response body will
        contain a JSON-formatted representation of the newly-updated program.

        Only users with global administrative rights may update programs. PATCH requests from non-
        admins will result in status 403.

        # Find completed programs.
        POST /api/v1/programs/complete/

        Request body must include a serialized representation of completed course runs, including
        the modes in which the runs were completed. Expected to be of the form:

        {'completed_courses': [
            {'course_id': 'foo', 'mode': 'bar'},
            ...
            {'course_id': 'baz', 'mode': 'qux'}
        ]}

        If the request is successful, the HTTP status will be 200 and the response body will
        include JSON containing the IDs of the completed programs.

    **Response Values**

        * id: The ID of the program.
        * name: The user-facing display name for this Program.
        * subtitle: A brief, descriptive subtitle for the Program.
